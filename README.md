# Pands project 2022

This is my project for Programming and Scripting module. To start, I read through the website that the data set is available on (ref 1). 
The Iris Data Set by Fisher, 1936 is a data set which consists of "3 classes of 50 instances each", each class referes to a type of iris plant. 
The attributes that distinguish each type of iris plant are
      1. Sepal length in cm
      2. Sepal width in cm
      3. Petal width in cm
      5. Class
         -- Iris Setonsa
         -- Iris Versicolour
         -- Iris Vinginica
