# Pands project 2022

Introduction

This is my project for Programming and Scripting module. To start, I read through the website that the data set is available on (ref 1). 
The Iris Data Set by Fisher, 1936 is a data set which consists of "3 classes of 50 instances each", each class referes to a type of iris plant. 
The attributes (variables) that distinguish each type of iris plant are
      1. Sepal length in cm
      2. Sepal width in cm
      3. Petal width in cm
      4. Class
         -- Iris Setonsa
         -- Iris Versicolour
         -- Iris Vinginica


To analyse the data, I researched Pandas (tutorials on Pandas documentation, further reading), allows users to analyse a data set, sort the data and add value. 

Put dataset into tables called dataframes, to put data into a table with rows and tables.

Add csv data to repository
To do;
 - summary of each variable to a single text file (overview of entire data set)
 - Histogram of each vairable to png files
 - Scatter plot for each pair of vairables
 - Any other analysis (correlation)

# TO DO

1. Importing dataset to repo as csv file. Write in file, headings ( https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-csv-file/).
   Sort the data to a single text file. Add headings.
